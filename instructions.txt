In order to run this code, please make sure to do the following:
1. Download the file from the link in: TMDB_data.txt. This will allow you to train the custom model we made based off of a huge corpus of movie plot summaries from 2008 - 2024 (almost 1 million summaries)
2. After doing so, move it to the working directory for this particular project
3. Please make sure you are using the word2vec environment we created in class and install all of the other missing packages if there are any
4. Run the code by typing 'python3 movsearch.py' and wait. It will take a while for the queries to print out
5. The genres and moods you can pick from are listed in the terminal
6. Here is what the general file structure should look like:
   project directory:
     Movie_Summaries (folder):
         - movie.metadata.tsv
         - plot_summaries.txt
     - mood.py
     - movsearch.py
     - sentiment.py
     - year_pref.py
     - functions.py
     - description.py
     - making_df.py
     - instructions.txt
     - TMDB_movie_dataset_v11.csv
  These are all of the files you need to successfully run this code.
